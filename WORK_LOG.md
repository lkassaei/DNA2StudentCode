| Oct 14 | 6-7pm  | I started my v1 by trying to just pass some testcases, without efficiency in mind. I thought about my algorithm a lot, deciding to have a for loop that scans in chunks the length of the STR, and finds the count of consecutive instances of STR. It stores that count in an array, and does that for every starting index in the sequence. Then it returns the largest count in the count array. |

For the rest of them, my code was too unefficient so they timed out. Now that I have a working algorithm, I am going to think about how to categorically improve it. |
