| Oct 14 | 6-7pm  | I started my v1 by trying to just pass sometestcases, without efficiency in mind. I thought about my algorithm a lot, deciding to have a for loop that scans in chunks of the length of the STR, and finds the count of consecutive. It stores that count in an array, and does that for every starting index in the sequence. |
