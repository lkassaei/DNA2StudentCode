I thought about my algorithm a lot, deciding to have a for loop that scans in chunks the length of the STR, and finds the count of consecutive instances of STR. It stores that count in an array, and does that for every starting index in the sequence. Then it returns the largest count in the count array. |

For the rest of them, my code was too inefficient so they timed out. Now that I have a working algorithm, I am going to think about how to categorically improve it. |
| Oct 16 |   1-145    | I started thinking about how to optimize my solution enough to even run all of the testcases, and I know I have to improve 2 things. The first thing is that I could categorically improve what I am checking. I am using a nested for loop, so my solution is O(n^2). I know that if I stop covering ground I have already covered many times, I can improve this. The second thing is that I can improve the comparison between the chunks of DNA sequence and the STR. Mr. Blick suggested that I have an 8 byte budget for constant lookups, so I immediately thought of assigning each char to an int, and adding them to get a number for a String. Then I could compare the ints to see equality. However, I am not sure about this because it is still proportional to the word. So I am still thinking about efficiency. |

So back to the drawing board for me... |

I still don't understand the math, but thought about the sliding window technique in the main function. I did not fully implement it, but updated my naive solution to what we discussed in class which worked much better (5/6 testcases) |

Now, I am at about 1-2 seconds of runtime so I am thinking of how to make it more efficient. |
